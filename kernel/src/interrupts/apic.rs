/// Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC) is a hardware component that manages the
/// delivery of interrupt requests to processors. Multiple components external to the processor
/// (keyboard, timer, peripherals, etc) may try to generate an IRQ, and it is the APIC's job to
/// deliver those. You can find more information on PIC here: https://wiki.osdev.org/8259_PIC
